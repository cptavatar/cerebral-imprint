cerebral-imprint
================

CerebralImprint is a cocoa flashcard app I wrote mostly almost 10 years ago to learn Objective-C


It allows one to import/export/edit decks, then perform either multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, 
or simple flip-the-card flashcard style quizzes using your standard forward/backwards/random/leitner options.


I've dusted off this old beast since I felt like adding a "keyboard shortcut" test mode (similar to fill in the blank, but
listens for the proper keypress) to work on memorizing shortcuts for a couple of editors. Its a work in progress....

(todo - get link to binary up here somewhere)

Quick Hints
	•	Click the + button to add a new card deck or select "Import Deck" from the file menu to import from a text file. 
	•	To get a lot of cards in the system quickly it's probably quickest to type them up in a text file, one side per line is simplest, and import them. 
	•	To rename a deck, double click on the name. 
	•	To add, edit, or delete the cards in a deck right click on the deck and select "Edit Deck".
	•	For Flash Card tests you can just use the arrow keys -  down arrow is mapped to "Flip", right arrow is "Right", left arrow is "Wrong" and up arrow is "Previous Card".
	•	For Multiple Choice tests the 1-4 keys are mapped to answers 1-4. Return is mapped to "Next". 
	•	For all tests, "q" quits the test.
