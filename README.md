cerebral-imprint
================

CerebralImprint is a cocoa flashcard app I wrote mostly almost 10 years ago to learn Objective-C


It allows one to import/export/edit decks, then perform either multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, 
or simple flip-the-card flashcard style quizzes using your standard forward/backwards/random/leitner options.


I've dusted off this old beast since I felt like adding a "keyboard shortcut" test mode (similar to fill in the blank, but
listens for the proper keypress) to work on memorizing shortcuts for a couple of editors. Its a work in progress....
